# AO 1st adventure game pseudocode stage!

# import random for certain enemy attacks, some might have a pattern ( could be changed  )

# Import time so that everything doesn't appear at once, 

# Mark does five damage with no weapon and 20 health with no armor and no defense

# The game will start wow... By someone pressing that play button looking thing is VS code



# Need a dictionary for items equipped I will need help on that
# need a dictionary for stats

# The setting will begin with 'Mark' waking up at home

# display " this feels famaliar, " wait a second display " make myself breakfast, bacon, eggs, like always"
# wait a bit again... display " i thought to myself something feels different..."

# wait a bit again, display " I look around, I seem to have forgotten everything, the world seems shattered..."

# wait a bit again " I feel like someone is there, may we go outside?" User input " Yes " or " No "

# if user chooses " yes ", Mark goes outside, to be greeted by his neighbor who's name he doesn't remember
# display " Hey Mark! How's it going? You should head towards the forest, the weather is nice! "
# wait a bit... display "... "
# display "awfully quiet huh? Oh well! There's new bridges, one connects to the forest, a desert and a new town! Go visit those some time! See you... around "

# ELSE IF user choose ' no '

# Display " Let it be that way then... Do you want it to end? 
# choice ' yes ', ' no '




#  if user picks ' no ' Mark heads outside, to be greeted by his neighbor who's name he doesn't remember

# wait a bit... display "... "
# display "awfully quiet huh? Oh well! There's new bridges, one connects to the forest, a desert and a new town! Go visit those some time! See you... around "


# ELSE if user says ' yes ' display Freedom... and Break

# display I wish I had the strength to talk... Where shall we go?
# Break to add onto another loop so when it continues it doesn't go back to the beginning! 


# while True so it doesn't break completely 

# user choice 'forest', 'desert', ' home ', 'new town' 

# If user is not either of those, display " Really? Are you messing with me? " continue command to go back up

# Else if user choice is 'desert' make a different while true statement
# display " it'll be a long journey for me... Man...Why did they make such a wide bridge...? Shouldn't this... Break...?" wait a bit...
# display " oh well... I'm almost there, " wait a second...
# display " it's very sandy...Like most deserts... Where to? "
# user choice ' forward ', 'left', 'right', 

# if user choice is ' forward ' 
    # display " Man you really like to go forward a lot... " wait a bit
    # display "Huh... A temple...I don't remember there being a desert temple..."
    # make a nested loop once more
# ELSE if user choice is ' right ' 
    # display " We're heading to the desert town, my old home. " wait a bit
    # display " I don't remember this being here... what is...That...? Looks like a golem... A guardian..." wait a second
    # display " A gemstone... So bright in its chest, I want it... " 
    # user choice ' Don't ' ( attempt to fight temptation ), ' go past it ', ' go for it '

    # if user choice is 'don't ' 
        # Display " i can't resist... i need it..."
        # Then mark will engage with the desert golem, 
        # make a nested loop, again



# And make a nested while true! If...That doesn't break it...
# If user choice is ' forest ' skip this if it is not... forest
# Display " that's far... I'm willing to go... Far... Far... " wait a bit... 3 seconds. display " I'm here. "

# display " Why did you bring me here...? There are sticks everywhere... "
# user choice 'pick up' ( Stick ) , 'continue further', 'go back' 

# If user choice ' pick up ' display "okay...? " add stick damage to damage stat and weapon equipped in dictionary

# display What now...? user choice ' pick up (stick)', ' continue further ', 'go back '
# if user choice is pick up display" I'm not picking up another one... "

# a sign, it displays " The gate is a bridge to all biomes, you may head anywhere from here. "
# display " To the new town, to home town, to the desert, to the forest, to the jungle, to the temple. so...Many possibilites, "
# wait a bit... display " Man, that's a lot... Where to from here...? Where should we go? No...I wanna go home...Or back...No where else yet... Please... "

# user choice, 'home town ', 'the jungle', ' forest ', ' new town ' 



# Might make certain enemies go at the same time as the player rather than one another... Inspiration from a different game
# ELSE if user choice is fight Mark wakes the wolf up my hitting it with the stick. 
# Wolf has 50 Hp, no armor, deals 5 damage with scratch, 8 with pounce and none with howl

# Mark can block with his stick if he has one if block is succesful heal mark by 3 hp, stab with the stick deals 8 damage,
# Mark has 20 HP, armor reduces damage, if you had gotten any before heading here
