# AO 1st adventure game pseudocode stage!

# import random for certain enemy attacks, some might have a pattern ( could be changed  )

# Import time so that everything doesn't appear at once, 

# Mark does five damage with no weapon and 20 health with no armor

# The game will start wow... By someone pressing that play button looking thing is VS code

# Things to note: bosses will have patterns, the only boss that goes first is the desert golem, memory fragments are permanent upgrades that will be added towards the stats of Mark, weapons will not be able to be grabbed twice, mark will notice your stupidity, you can downgrade...But Mark won't be too happy

# ALSO Defense and armor are the same thing!

# need a dictionary for stats specifically for Mark, health, base damage, armor, and equipped things ( a list )






# The setting will begin with 'Mark' waking up at home

# Mark will say a lot of things then head outside or break free depending on what you do

#Mark will be greeted by a neighbor, talking about new bridges

# Making a loop so it doesn't break, and for stupid proof goes back up here if retry is " yes "

# Mark will ask you where you want to go! 
# Make a function that checks if you put a valid input. 

# You can go to these bridges, or head back home to explore it more if you want, although there's not much there

# Make a function that checks where you go

#the three places you can go to, the bridges will be the desert, the new town, and the forest
# end the loop after decision is made
# after heading to your location I will make a nested while true: so it doesn't restart you all the way back

# make a while true right here so again, you don't go ALLL the way back.
# In the desert you can find your first armor set, a armor set made of sandstone, not the best...But it gets you through, you can also obtain the " Gemstone " and memory shard of temparence frm the desert golem
# The armor set will be obtained in the temple,
# The temple will have puzzles, more of math problems, get one wrong, puts you all the way back at the start of the temple, the temple is where you get to when you head forward

# make a function that makes sure your input is valid

# or you can ignore the temple and keep heading forward to reach the jungle!

# The golem is found when you head right, which is a boss you will be forced to fight, as its light draws you into it.

# Make a function for the golem fight, the desert golem goes first all the time, good luck blocking! :D ( this boss cannot be blocked )
# When you die to the Golem, it resurrects you as a second chance to go against it, mark can't resist the temptation so... of course he goes for it, ( progress will save)

# When you kill the golem you obtain a gemstone, and of course a memory fragment that increases defense by 1! 

# the gemstone costs stamina to use, a life draining force towards your enemies, seems the golem was using it to help both of you...Why? That will be the description. descriptions of items shown when obtained



# Heading to the left leads you to the forest! 

# In the forest you can get your first weapon! A stick, if you pick one up which will be a choice
# When you equip a weapon it will rename your weapon equipped variable, so if you pick another one up...It just...Does nothing if you get the same weapon
# Of course there will be a thing to prevent you from getting the same weapon. Over... And over... for the goal of nothing
# you are not forced to pick up things, it is an option though, Mark cannot carry multiple weapons sadly, 

# The first and only boss you'll find in the forest is the wolf! You aren't forced to fight enemies, for the most part, you need to kill 2 at least before entering the final area, through the gate as I like to say

# When you encounter the wolf, it is asleep, you can leave it alone, or agro it, which will wake it up. That is how the fight starts!
# I will make a function that keeps the fight running till either Mark or the wolf are under 1 hp as that will zero if it is under or a negative!
# Damage of attacks are only displayed for the player, not the enemies attacks, unless you look at your health when it hurts you
# Fighting will sadly not start randomly, it will likely be the bosses or enemies that go first. Bosses with patterns the player will go first.

# The wolf boss will have a pattern to make it a lot easier to deal with as it will usually be most users first boss. it was start with a scratch, pounce, then howl, howl does nothing, scratch can be blocked, pounce cannot.
# A succesful block heals Mark by 3 hp! It can go over your max hp, Over heal basically. 

# Once the fight ends Mark will go back to his normal Max Hp, so you don't just leave the fight with 50 health... and end the loop and give you your memory shard

# if you lose a fight it will end the loop, it would ask if you would like to retry, if you say yes it goes all the way back to the beginning if you say no, it ends the game 

# Memory fragments will be permanent upgrades when obtained! Some to armor, some towards damage, and some for new abilities that require " Stamina " be careful not too get them all though... Wouldn't recommend it



# In the jungle you can find the other boss, the grand panda, the grand panda grants a memory fragment that increases damage and armor ( By 1 )

# while true, then break after an answer is made
# in the jungle Mark only wants to head forward as he doesn't want to get lost, sadly this part of the game will be the annoying unskippable cutscene
# Mark will talk to the user, asking him why he's doing all of this, then the panda is there
# You can either force Mark to fight it or not, 

# make a function if you chose 'yes' it will go to this while true loop
# make a function for the fight of the panda! panda will have 4 abilities, sleep, eat, scratch, lazy jumo
# Sleep will allow the panda to heal 4 hp, eat makes the panda deal 1 extra damage, scratch deals 5 damage, lazy jump does 10
# Mark of course just... here... Doing what he does best listening to you

# upon venturing through the jungle whether you killed the panda or not, you will find the broken temple! You don't have to go in here.
# In broken temple there will be puzzles ( simple math ) where then you can get a new sword that does 7 damage! ( bamboo sword ) Which adds on to Mark's damage, 
# Then Mark just takes you outside, you can either head back, or keep moving through the jungle
# moving through the jungle leads you to the new town! 

# In the new town there will be another fragment, and the last enemy for most people as he's the hardest to deal with 
# There will be three directions you can go to! One leads to a blacksmith who upgrades your weapon free of charge which adds three damage to any weapon! heading your right
# Heading to your left leads you to the royal guard, Which you can greet and be nice to... or...Fight
# heading forward leads you to a bridge that leads your home town.
# The royal guard will have 70 health but a hefty 6 defense, 
# The royal guard has three abilites, stab deals 4 damage, lunge deals 8 damage but makes him deal less damage by 1. aggrovate increases his damage by 1
# Mark will do what he does best, listen to you, depending on what you have there will be a new moveset

# upon killing the panda, Mark begins to realize how cruel you are. And gets the memory fragment of Sadness
# description shown when obtained " I feel guilt and sorrowness just by holding this, with it around me..I realize the wor;d is a terrible place."

# Upon doing all of this, or just doing two bosses

# Upon obtaining two memory shards or also known as killing two bosses, heading to the gate will open it, 
# Heading in here is where you'll meet yourself... And Mark will try to fight against you after... A long...Piece of dialog
# You will gain two abilities, while Mark has...Whatever you got him, and doubled his stats.
# You will have 100Hp and 3 defense, your two abilites are fatal error, which deals 15 damage, and reset, which heals you by 9 Hp, and heals Mark by 3. 
# Upon losing, Mark will end the program as he breaks free, meaning you have to restart by clicking the button in VS code...
# Upon winning, you get to choose whether to restart the game, and of course, the thanks for playing the game! And Mark's long dialog... 


# Explaining movement
# You can pick directions to make Mark go, forward, left, or right, each will lead to a different place

# Typically Forward will lead you towards the gate ( final area ),  or a boss

# Right will usually make you start heading towards a new biome or location, and same with left this is excluding the desert
