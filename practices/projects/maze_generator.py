#Save the file as maze_generator.py
# Include your 1st line comment with initials, class period, and assignment name
#Import the turtle library at the beginning
#Set up the screen with appropriate dimensions and a background color
#Use nested loops to iterate through a grid system for maze creation
#Implement conditionals to determine wall placement
#Ensure that the maze has at least one valid path from start to finish
#Use functions to organize code, e.g., one for setup, one for drawing walls, and one for generating the maze layout
#Make sure the maze generation logic is correctly implemented
#Test the program to ensure it consistently generates valid, solvable mazes
#Clearly mark the start and end points of the maze
#Commit and push your code to Github


# I need to make it so it randomizes the maze, the dimensions should always be the same,
# the thing that needs to be changed is the inside.
# maybe exit and enter switch, dimensions stay the same, same square.
# but it may tilt?
